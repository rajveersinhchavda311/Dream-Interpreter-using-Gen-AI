Testing the Application
Create a test script to verify functionality:

python
# test_dreams.py
import streamlit as st
from dream_interpreter import DreamInterpreter

def test_dream_analysis():
    interpreter = DreamInterpreter()
    
    # Test dream
    test_dream = "I was flying over a beautiful ocean, but then I started falling into the water"
    
    # Identify symbols
    symbols = interpreter.identify_symbols(test_dream)
    print(f"Symbols found: {symbols}")
    
    # Generate interpretation
    interpretation = interpreter.generate_interpretation(
        test_dream, "Anxious", "Starting new job", symbols
    )
    print(f"Interpretation: {interpretation}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_dream_analysis()
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Model Loading Error
Ensure you have sufficient disk space (2GB+)
Check internet connection for model download
Try restarting the application
Streamlit Port Issues
Use different port: streamlit run dream_interpreter.py --server.port 8502
Check if port 8501 is already in use
Memory Issues
Close other applications
Use GPT-2 small instead of medium (modify code)
Restart the application
Performance Tips
First Run: Model download may take 5-10 minutes
Subsequent Runs: Models are cached locally
Interpretation Speed: 3-5 seconds per dream analysis
Browser: Use Chrome/Firefox for best experience
